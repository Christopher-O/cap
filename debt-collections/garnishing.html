<p>As the legal representative of an estate, business or property, you must apply for a clearance certificate before you distribute any assets, unless you are a trustee in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The clearance certificate is proof that the taxpayer or registrant has paid all outstanding amounts owed to the CRA, or that the CRA has accepted security for the payment.</p>
<p>If you do not obtain a certificate, you can be held liable and subject to a third party assessment.</p>
<p>When a receiver is selling secured property to pay a security interest, they do not need a clearance certificate because the taxpayer does not own the property.

	    <details><summary>If your business fails to remit required payroll or GST/HST amounts</summary>
<p>[If you have not remitted your payroll or GST/HST amounts the CRA may collect from the creditors of the business or, if it’s a corporation, the directors of the corporation.]</p>
<p><strong>Collecting amounts from directors of corporations</strong></p>
<p>[CRA can issue a <strong>directors’ liability assessment</strong> against the corporation’s directors at the time when the corporation failed to deduct, withhold, or pay trust amounts. This assessment makes the directors personally liable, together with the corporation, to pay part or all of the corporation’s trust debt. It allows the CRA to take legal action against the directors to collect the debt as it would from the corporation. The liability includes penalties and interest associated with these trust amounts.]</p>
<p><strong>Collecting amounts from creditors of businesses</strong></p>
<p>[The CRA has the authority to collect amounts considered held “in trust” by your business. These amounts include payroll deductions and GST/HST collected. This claim letter gives the CRA priority over other creditors collecting amounts owed to them. If you have a deemed trust debt owing to the CRA, the amount of the debt becomes secured to the CRA over all your assets, regardless of any security interest you may have given to other creditors. The CRA also has priority over the proceeds of the sale of any of your assets.</p>
<p>The CRA does not have to register deemed trust debts in a public registry, such as a personal property security registry or a land titles office registry.</p>
<p>The CRA may issue a <strong>deemed trust claim letter</strong> to a creditor because of the CRA's priority over the proceeds of a sale. This could occur, for example, if you sold a business asset and used the proceeds of the sale to pay a debt to a creditor, instead of paying your deemed trust debt to the CRA.</p>
<p>The CRA cannot declare a GST/HST deemed trust claim against a secured creditor who received proceeds from the sale of a taxpayer’s assets if the taxpayer has filed an insolvency event, unless the CRA established their security interest before/upon the filing.   </p>
<p>Deemed trust priority can be a complicated issue. You may wish to seek legal or professional advice.]</p>

	    <h2>Putting a lien on or seizing your assets</h2>
		<p>[plain text explaining what this means]</p>
	    <p>The CRA can get a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court confirming the amount you owe. This will make your debt a matter of public record and allow the CRA to place a lien on or seize your assets.</p>

<details><summary>Registering a lien on your assets</summary>
	    <p>[Once your debt is certified, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can register a lien against your assets and property, including your personal residence. Registering a lien will secure the amount of debt owing, by establishing creditor priority in the event of a sale. This means, if you sell your asset, your <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> tax debt is automatically paid from the proceeds of the sale, before you receive any remaining proceeds.]</p>
	<h4><abbr title="Canada Border Services Agency">CBSA</abbr> (customs) liens at the border</h4>
	<p>[Once your debt is certified, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may:</p>
<ul>
<li>suspend your importation privileges</li>
<li>Apply a lien against goods imported by you</li>
<li>Apply a lien against goods reported for exportation by you</li>
</ul>
]</p>
</details>
	    <details><summary>Seizing and selling your assets</summary>
	    <p>[If your debt remains outstanding, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may get a <a title="writ or memorial" class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#inline_content_modal">writ or memorial</a> to seize and sell your assets and property. This could include your car, boat, artwork, cottage, rental property, or personal residence.</p>
<p>If the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> sells your assets, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will use the proceeds to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>your tax debt</li>
<li>any costs charged by the bailiff hired to sell the assets on behalf of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr></li>
</ul>
<p>You will still have to pay any remaining tax debt.]</p>
