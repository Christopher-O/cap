<h2 id="notify">How we notify you that your account is in collections</h2>

<p>If you have a debt you cannot pay on time, the first thing to do is try to <a href="payment-arrangements.html">make an arrangement to pay your debt in smaller payments over time</a>.
<p>If you have a debt and have not contacted us to make arrangements to pay it, or if you do not make your scheduled payments, we may begin legal collections actions.</p>
	    <p>Normally, we notify you of a balance you owe on a Notice of Assessment, Notice of Reassessment, or Notice of Determination.</p>
	    <p>Make sure it's really the CRA contacting you before giving out your personal information: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud/expect-cra-contacts.html">What to expect when the CRA contacts you</a></p>
  <p id="notify">If you owe a debt with the CRA for more than 90 days after we notify you, CRA collections will generally:
<ul><li>make up to <strong>3</strong> attempts to give you a verbal legal warning by phone</li>
<li>send <strong>1</strong> written legal warning letter</li></ul>
	<p>However, if your business owes a <strong>payroll or GST/HST remittance debt</strong>, in some cases we may begin collections actions right after you are notified of your debt.</p>
	    
	    <details>
	<summary>Business debts and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</summary>
	    
<p id="corporate-actions">For <strong>GST/HST remittance and payroll deduction debts</strong>, the notice of assessment or reassessment is considered the written legal warning for amounts owing. Once a verbal legal warning is attempted, the CRA can proceed with collections actions. The CRA can continue to collect amounts assessed on corporate accounts even if you filed an objection or an appeal to the Tax Court. </p>
	    <p>If you are a <strong>large corporation</strong>, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and have filed an objection or an appeal, the CRA can start collecting 50% of your assessed income tax owing right away.</p>
	    <p>For <strong>corporate tax, GST/HST remittance, payroll, and COVID-19 business subsidy debts</strong>, <a href="setoffs">set-offs</a> can be issued as soon as a notice of determination/assessment has been sent.</p>
		    <p>If we determine there is a risk of not collecting all or part of your assessed corporate income tax or COVID-19 business subsidy overpayment debt while you are under collection restrictions, we can apply to the Federal Court or the superior court of a province for a <strong>jeopardy order</strong>. This allows the CRA to secure any assets that you own and to take immediate action to collect the debt.</p>
