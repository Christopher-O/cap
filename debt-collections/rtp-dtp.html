	    <p>Sometimes we may garnish funds from a third party who owes (or will owe) money to someone with an outstanding debt. A third party could include a person or organization such as an employer or bank, or another source of income.</p>

<h2 id="toc1">What garnishments are: RTPs, ERTPs and DTPs</h2>

      	    <p>If we are unable to collect an amount owing or make an arrangement to pay a debt, we may request funds from a third party who owes (or will owe) money to the person or business with the debt.</p>
        <p>We send these requests (called <strong>garnishments</strong>) as one of the following legal documents:</p>
        <ul>
<li>Requirement to pay (RTP)</li>
<li>Enhanced requirement to pay (ERTP)</li>
<li>Demand on a third party (DTP)</li>
        </ul>

      
<p>RTPs, ERTPs and DTPs tell a third party that some or all money normally paid to or held by someone who owes a debt is now payable to the CRA or to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). These documents allow the CRA to take those funds from the third party. </p>
  
<p>If you receive an RTP, ERTP, or DTP, you are obligated to comply with it. The person or business who owes the debt cannot go after you financially for the amounts you send us.</p>

<p>We send a copy to of the RTP, ERTP, or DTP to the person or business who owes the debt at the same time we send it to you. The amount you owe the taxpayer is reduced by the amount you send to us.</p>

<p>An RTP and DTP gives us priority over most other creditors. However, a secured creditor with an interest on assets may have a higher priority over us. RTP and DTP are used to collect debts for income tax, corporate tax, emergency programs or government programs, such as Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Canada Student Loan (CSL).</p>
        
<p>ERTPs give us priority over the interests of secured creditors. ERTPs are used to collect payroll deductions, GST/HST, or Air Travellers Security charges that a taxpayer has failed to pay.</p>
        
<p>We have the authority to send RTPs and ERTPs without a court order.
DTP can be issued once the CRA has obtained a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court. They are issued mostly for EI, CPP or CSL debts.</p>
