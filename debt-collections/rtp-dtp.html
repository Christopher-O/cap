	    <p>Sometimes we may garnish funds from a third party who owes (or will owe) money to someone with an outstanding debt. A third party could include a person or organization such as an employer or bank, or another source of income.</p>

<h2 id="toc1">What garnishments are: RTPs, ERTPs and DTPs</h2>

      	    <p>If we are unable to collect an amount owing or make an arrangement to pay a debt, we may request funds from a third party who owes (or will owe) money to the person or business with the debt.</p>
        <p>We send these requests (called <strong>garnishments</strong>) as one of the following legal documents:</p>
        <ul>
<li>Requirement to pay (RTP)</li>
<li>Enhanced requirement to pay (ERTP)</li>
<li>Demand on a third party (DTP)</li>
        </ul>

      
<p>RTPs, ERTPs and DTPs tell a third party that some or all money normally paid to or held by someone who owes a debt is now payable to the CRA or to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). These documents allow the CRA to take those funds from the third party. </p>
  
<p>If you receive an RTP, ERTP, or DTP, you are obligated to comply with it. </p>

<p>An RTP and DTP gives us priority over most other creditors. However, a secured creditor with an interest on assets may have a higher priority over us. RTP and DTP are used to collect debts for income tax, corporate tax, emergency programs or government programs, such as Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Canada Student Loan (CSL).</p>
        
<p>ERTPs give us priority over the interests of secured creditors. ERTPs are used to collect payroll deductions, GST/HST, or Air Travellers Security charges that a taxpayer has failed to pay.</p>
        
<p>We have the authority to send RTPs and ERTPs without a court order.
DTP can be issued once the CRA has obtained a provincial judgement or a certificate from the Federal Court. They are issued mostly for EI, CPP or CSL debts.</p>

      <h2 id="toc2">Types of payments we can request</h2>

<p>A garnishment can be sent for different types of payments, such as:
	<ul>
<li>Salary, wages, commissions, bonuses</li>
<li>Money held at your financial institution</li>
<li>Reimbursement of expenses owed to an employee</li>
<li>Rent or lease payments</li>
<li>Loans made by a corporation to a taxpayer, when the corporation is not dealing with the taxpayer at arm’s length (refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-5-transfer-income-property-rights-third-parties/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length</a>)</li>
<li>Annuity, interest, dividends and other investment proceeds</li>
<li>Accounts receivable</li>
<li>Proceeds of an insurance claim</li>
	</ul>
</p>

      <h2 id="toc3">If you receive a garnishment</h2>
<p>You are obligated to comply with a garnishment you receive.The person or business who owes the debt cannot go after you financially for the amounts you send us.</p>

<p>We send a copy to of the RTP, ERTP, or DTP to the person or business who owes the debt at the same time we send it to you. The amount you owe the taxpayer is reduced by the amount you send to us.</p>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> sell any assets such as houses, cars, jewellery, stocks, or bonds unless you have instructions to do so from the person or business who owes the debt or another person who has the authority to give instructions. The garnishment applies to the sale proceeds if the assets (such as the person’s house) are sold and converted into cash while it is in effect.</p>

<details><summary>If you are having difficulty identifying the person</summary>
<p>Call the contact number listed on the garnishment right away.</p>
</details>
	    
<details><summary>If you owe money to the person and payment is due</summary>
<p>Deduct the amount according to the instructions on the garnishment and send it to the address indicated right away.</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>Keep a copy of the RTP because you may owe money to the taxpayer in the future. </li>
<li>Call the contact number listed on the garnishment, or return the completed response form to explain why you will not be making a payment.</li></ol></p>
</details>	

<details><summary>If you owe money to the person but they no longer work for you</summary>
<p><strong>RTP or ERTP</strong></p>
<p>You have to send us money from the employee's final pay. You will find instructions on the first page telling you how much to send.</p>

</ol>
</details>
	    
<details><summary>If the person claims to have made arrangements with the CRA</summary>

</details>
	
<details><summary>If you are already sending some of the money you owe the person to another creditor</summary>
<p>You must comply with the garnishment. If there is not enough to pay the other creditor and the CRA’s garnishment, call our contact number listed on the document right away.</p>

<p>If you receive a phone call from a trustee, continue to honour the garnishment request until you receive written confirmation of the insolvency filing.</p> 
<p>Call our contact number listed on the document before you take any action. In some instances, the money owed to the taxpayer belongs to the CRA or ESDC. If you distribute any money, you may become liable.</p>
</details>
	
	<details><summary>If you plan to loan or advance money to an employee or to someone who you are not dealing with at arm’s length with, within 90 days from the date you receive the RTP or ERTP</summary>
<p>You are required to send the money to us. For more information, see Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length.</p>
</details>
	    

      <h3 id="toc4">If you don't comply with a garnishment you receive</h3>

<p>You become liable for the amount you did not pay to us, and we will take action to collect that amount from you.</p>

<p>You become liable if you:</p>
	<ul>
<li>do not pay us when you owe money to the person who owes the debt</li>
<li>continue to pay the person amounts you are legally required to pay to us</li>	
<li>pay someone else on behalf of the person, such as a relative or another creditor instead of us</li>
<li>loan or advance money to the person within 90 days <mark>of what?</mark>, if the specific term is included on the RTP</li>
</ul>

      <h2 id="toc5">How much you must pay</h2>

<p>The first page of the garnishment shows the maximum amount you must withhold from the person and send to us. Send this amount to the CRA or ESDC for each payment that you owe to the person <strong>unless</strong> the document instructs you to withhold one of the following:
	<ul>
<li>A fixed amount from each payment</li>
<li>A fixed amount from all amounts paid in a set time period, such as a month</li>
<li>A percentage from each payment</li>
	</ul></p>
<p>Continue to withhold and send these amounts to us during the effective period of the garnishment request, or until the total you have sent equals the maximum amount requested.</p>
<p>In some cases, the garnishment will also instruct you to send all amounts upon termination of employment.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>miscalculated your payments</strong> and paid more than you were required to pay, contact us at the number listed on the document.</p>

      <h2 id="toc6">How to pay</h2>

<p>Payments may be payable to the CRA or ESDC. The garnishment will tell you who and where to send your payment. </p>
<p>Remember to:
	<ul>
<li>Write the account number shown on the remittance form on the front of your cheque or money order
<li>Make your cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada
<li>Mail the remittance form, with your cheque or money order, to the address listed on the remittance form
<li>Keep a record of the amount and the date of your payment</li>
	</ul>


	    </p>
<p>If you <strong>sent a payment and then received a withdrawal</strong> of the requirement to pay, contact the CRA at the number provided on the notice.</p>

      <h2 id="toc7">Validity period</h2>

<p>You will find the terms on the first page of the garnishment. Generally, it may be valid for one of the following time periods:
	<ul>
<li>For 90 days</li>
<li>For 1 year</li>
<li>Until the debt is paid in full</li>
<li>Until we ask you in writing to stop the garnishment</li>
		</ul></p>
<p>Keep a copy of the garnishment for the entire period it is in effect and for at least 1 year after receiving it, as you may owe amounts to the person in the future.</p>
<p>Your obligation ends after one or more of the following situations happens:
	<ul>
<li>You no longer owe amounts to the person, and no other amounts become owing during the effective period of the garnishment</li>
<li>You sent money to us totalling the maximum amount shown on the garnishment</li>
<li>You receive a withdrawal letter from us indicating the garnishment is no longer in effect</li>
<li>The RTP or ERTP expires and is no longer valid</li>
